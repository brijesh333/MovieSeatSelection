Movie seat selection app is a quick project I created over the course of a day to get more familiar with AngularJS. I primarily used **AngularJS** (with **Node.js** as a backend). I used **Twitter Bootstrap** for a basic responsive website.

**User Stories:**
* User can Enter name and number of seat required
* After Entering data user can select the seats (s)he entered
* Then finalize the seat selection

[1] Tickets are not actually purchased or processed
